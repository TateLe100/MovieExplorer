# MovieExplorer

Welcome to Movie Explorer, my very first application built using React! This project is designed as a simple yet powerful interface to interact with a movie database API. Users can browse through a wide range of movies, search for specific titles, and mark their favorites for easy access later.

✨ Features
🔍 Search Functionality
Users can search for movies by title, enabling quick access to information about their favorite films or discover new ones.

⭐ Favorite Movies
Users can add movies to their favorites list with a single click. The app keeps track of all favorited movies and provides a separate view to manage them.

🔄 API Integration
The app connects to an external movie API (such as The Movie Database or OMDb) to fetch up-to-date information including movie posters, summaries, and release details.

⚛️ Built with React
This app uses modern React tools and concepts including functional components, hooks (such as useState and useEffect), and component-based architecture.

🚀 Goals of the Project
The purpose of this project is to strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals while working with real-world data through an external API. It also serves as a foundation for learning how to manage application state, handle user interactions, and create a responsive, dynamic front-end experience.
